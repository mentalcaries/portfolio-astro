In fact, I've gotten to a point where if I come across content that appears mostly AI-generated (a social media post, article or god forbid, a video), I couldn't be bothered to read or watch. Why? I'm not really interested in what AI *thinks* (if you can call it that). The "opinions" of AI usually just come down to its training data, which is generally what it was able to scrape off the freely available web. It might make great placeholder text, but otherwise, do people really think that the output of a prompt complete with emojis is *that* interesting? No, what might grab my attention is *the idea* that generated the prompt that caused the LLM to spit out some verbose fluff.
